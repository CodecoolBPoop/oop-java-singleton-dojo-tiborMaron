    // 1. Make Printer class a Singleton. I want to access an instance of the Printer class from anywhere in my code
    //    and call its print() method.
    // 2. Implement pooling: Assume we have 10 printers in the office, each with a different Id. The singleton
    //    accessor should return a random printer from these ten that is not busy. If all are busy return a random one.
    //    Keep the instances of these printers in the Printer class.
    //
    // Write some code that tests all functionality!
